Git is a version controller

It allows commits and merges

Collaborative work among peers

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
I would be able to compare the old version with the new, and what has been modified

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?
Pros: good judgement, good amount of version kept
Cons: User may forget to save/commit

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
They might be related to one another

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
Git log to check all commits from that repository
Git diff to see what was changed from one commit to the other

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
It allows us to check older versions and what was changed, and if a bug is introduced we can go back and see what was changed in order to cause such bug
