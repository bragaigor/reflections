When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When using another computer

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forks: Clone repositories on Github
Clones: Can be used localy and between Github and local
Branches: will be in both 

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

In case I want to refer back or broken something.
